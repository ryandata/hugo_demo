      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m on a trip at the moment, and a friend who generously let me sleep on his couch looked at my small travel backpack and commented on how little I travel with: “That’s impressive,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was a little surprised, because though I’ve gotten that comment before, it’s become normal for me to travel with just a small bag (10 lbs. or less, usually), and I have friends who travel with even less. But then I remembered that I’m far from normal in this way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Letting Go</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The end of procrastination is the art of letting go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a lifelong procrastinator, at least until recent years. I would put things off until deadline, because I knew I could come through. I came through on tests after cramming last minute, I turned articles in at the deadline after waiting until the last hour, I got things done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Until I didn’t. It turns out procrastinating caused me to miss deadlines, over and over. It stressed me out. My work was less-than-desirable when I did it last minute. Slowly, I started to realize that procrastination wasn’t doing me any favors. In fact, it was causing me a lot of grief.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fearlessness: How to Stop Running from Space</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We spend our days filling in every available space, cramming in more tasks, responding to messages, checking social media and online sites, watching videos.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are afraid of empty space in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The result is often a continual busyness, constant distraction and avoidance, lack of focus, lack of satisfaction with our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We run from silence. We run from the spaces between tasks and appointments. We run from solitude and stillness. We try to fill every second with activity, with something useful, as if silence and space are not valuable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
