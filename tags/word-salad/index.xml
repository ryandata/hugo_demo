      <description>&lt;p&gt;The end of procrastination is the art of letting go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a lifelong procrastinator, at least until recent years. I would put things off until deadline, because I knew I could come through. I came through on tests after cramming last minute, I turned articles in at the deadline after waiting until the last hour, I got things done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Until I didn’t. It turns out procrastinating caused me to miss deadlines, over and over. It stressed me out. My work was less-than-desirable when I did it last minute. Slowly, I started to realize that procrastination wasn’t doing me any favors. In fact, it was causing me a lot of grief.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
